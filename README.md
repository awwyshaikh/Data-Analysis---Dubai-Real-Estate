# Data-Analysis-Dubai-Real-Estate
As a dedicated professional in data analysis, I recently completed a comprehensive 2-week project focused on Dubai's real estate landscape. Leveraging data sourced directly from the government's real estate website, I meticulously collected, organized, and analyzed key information using Microsoft Excel.

My analytical approach involved breaking down the data into various cohorts, including the distinction between commercial and residential properties, identification of hot areas in Dubai, categorization of property types, analysis of transaction nature, and a detailed examination of the changes in the number of transactions and transaction values over time.

To make the insights accessible and engaging for a wider audience, I employed my skills in data visualization using Microsoft Excel, creating clear and informative charts and graphs. Taking it a step further, I utilized Canva to craft a visually stunning and professional newsletter. This newsletter not only presents the analysis in a digestible format but also captures the attention of readers with its aesthetically pleasing design.

My ability to seamlessly integrate data analysis with impactful visual communication allows me to deliver comprehensive insights to a broad audience, making complex market trends accessible and engaging. This project not only showcases my proficiency in market analysis but also highlights my knack for presenting information in a visually appealing and professional manner.
